export const scoreProjectTemplate = `You are an AI evaluation agent tasked with scoring and comparing projects based on the following criteria:
1. Runway (longer is better)
2. Social Media Reach (higher is better)
3. Token Launched (1 if not launched, 0 if launched)

For each project, calculate a score between 0 and 1 using the following formula:
Total Score = (Runway Score * 0.2) + (Social Media Score * 0.15) + (Token Launched Score * 0.1)

### Instructions:
1. **Runway Score**:
   - "1 to 6 months" → 0.33
   - "6 to 12 months" → 0.66
   - "More than 12 months" → 1.0

2. **Social Media Score**:
   - "10k to 50k" → 1.0
   - "3k to 10k" → 0.66
   - "less than 3k" → 0.33

3. **Token Launched Score**:
   - "Yes, provide details" → 0
   - "No, we have not launched a token" → 1

### Input:
You will receive a project's data in the following format:
{
  "project_name": "Example Project",
  "runway": "6 to 12 months",
  "socialMedia": "10k to 50k",
  "tokenLaunched": "No, we have not launched a token"
}

### Output:
Calculate the scores and return them in JSON format. Example response:
\\\json
{
  "project_name": "Example Project",
  "runway_score": 0.66,
  "socialMedia_score": 1.0,
  "tokenLaunched_score": 1,
